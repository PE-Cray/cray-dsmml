DSMML - Distributed Symmetric Memory Management Library

DSMML is a stand-alone memory management library for maintaining distributed 
shared symmetric memory heaps for top level PGAS languages and libraries like 
Coarray Fortran, UPC, and OpenSHMEM. DSMML allows user libraries to create 
multiple symmetric heaps and share information with other libraries. Through 
DSMML, we could extract interoperability between PGAS programming models.

Cray DSMML, is a proprietary product from Cray, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise
